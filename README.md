**TaskMaster is a free utility application for Windows to keep desired tasks running and prevent unwanted tasks that cannot otherwise be disabled or uninstalled from running on your computer.**

The Task Killer allows us to set processes that we would like to end anytime they are detected to be running.  The Task Launcher allows us to set processes that we would like to be restarted if closed or crashed.  We can also set auxiliary applications in any Task Launcher entry, to be launched alongside the target application if closed or crashed.  Finally, we can switch the target application from 'launch' to 'detect' mode, so if the target application is detected to be running, the auxiliary apps are launched if closed or crashed.

A wide variety of user customization options are available under the Settings tab, including style and scale - the color theme will follow Windows settings for Light/Dark application modes in 'Auto' mode, or you can manually set it to Light or Dark as you prefer.  TaskMaster has a localization system currently supporting English and Spanish at first release, and will expand to allow external language packs to be created and/or loaded by any user.  A custom (or external) color theme system is being considered as well, to provide more flexibility and personalization.

> ***TaskMaster is a good example of my current skills as I continue to transition from hobbyist tinkerer into a more professional programmer. I still have much to learn, but am proud of where I am today, and of how TaskMaster has turned out. Thanks for checking out my latest freeware app!** &nbsp; -SemlerPDX*
